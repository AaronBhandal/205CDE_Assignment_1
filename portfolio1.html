                    <h3>Year 1 - Project 1</h3>
                    <h5>Drawing Application using Processing</h5>
                    <p>We were tasked with creating a drawing app that incorporated standard features youâ€™d see in a professional application. Each week we were given 2 features that we had to try and add into our application.</p>
                    <p>To create the application we were advised to use a program called Processing, this was because the program had compatibility with the Nexus 7 tablets we received at the beginning of the course and we could export our application onto the tablet for testing.</p>
                    <img src="screen-shot-2015-03-12-at-12-57-10.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image">
                    <p style="padding-top: 10px">Processing had a very Java-esque feel to it, many functions and the way of calling were almost identical, having had experience with Javascript before this made fine tweaking my code much more easier. I used example code from the Processing website as a basis then using my own knowledge played with that code to make it suit my application.</p>
                    <p>The end application was almost identical to what I had planned a the beginning of the project. All the major features I wanted were fully functioning and looked professional. As you can see in the image below I tried my best to make the application look simplistic yet still including complex functions.</p>
                    <p>Programming has always been something I have been very fond of and is what I want to do in the future. Learning new languages like Processing and expanding my knowledge on programming is one of the reasons university has been extremely beneficial to me.</p>

                    <p style="padding-top: 20px">Due to members of my group dropping out from the course or being absent I completed this whole project on my own, I believe this reflects on my skills to program and plan independently and also my work ethic. The project was supposed to be completed in groups of 4, but instead I myself tried my best to mange my time to complete all the tasks given to me and produced in my opinion a very sleek and professional application.</p>
