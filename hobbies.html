                    <div style="text-align: center">
                        <p>The hobby I most enjoy must be drawing. From a young age I was introduced to drawing by my mother, from then on I would get urges to pick up a pencil and start to sketch eyes, faces or full body people. Art became something very important to me the older I got, I attended a few competitions and won a few prizes in and out of secondary school which motivated me to pursue a career in it, the only problem was I viewed art as a getaway from everyday work and when I felt like I needed a breather. Drawing was always the best form of stress relief for me, picking up a pencil and sketching random images in my head was something I found extremely relaxing. Over the years i have kept a folder full of drawings I have created over the years, below are a few of them.</p>
                        <p>Drawing has also made its impact on my studies at university, being able to look at an website or program and seeing what I believe to be design flaws that I could make better, has helped me excel in my projects and my Design and Usability module. Before even the planning stages of a project my mind overflows with concept designs I could produce and having the ability to sketch them out gives me a head start on the design process as I can immediately see flaws and correct them.</p>
