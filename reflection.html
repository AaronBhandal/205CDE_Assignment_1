                    <p>Before attending university I thought of myself to have an in depth understanding of computing and various aspects of it. After the last 24 weeks of various projects and lab tasks I believe my understanding to have become much more refined, the number of aspects of computing i have experience with has expanded and my knowledge has become much more vast in such a short amount of time.</p>
                    <p>University on a whole has been an amazing experience for me, form creating my own website and building numerous applications for the Nexus 7, I have learnt that there is much more to computing than what can be researched on your own. Without being told prior of stuff such as the vast amount of programming languages available, and the many different languages that can do the same job, but very differently, for example Python & C++.</p>
                    <p>Compared to the generic use of Macintosh or Windows operating systems, we were introduced to Linux, a completely command line based OS. This was a huge learning curve for me, being very used to purely visual operating systems that did not require a command line or terminal unless for very specific needs, was very interesting to try out.</p>
                    <p>The biggest problem throughout university would have been that the projects were conducted in groups, communication wise I can talk and get along with groups very well, but the problem with this is that group members get too comfortable and tend to slack. When conducting work in groups we normally split the work load equally between this but this ended up causing problems with absences and group members not replying to messages and emails. To overcome the problem of group members not fulfilling their share of the work, I gladly took on their work load and completed it within time so that me and my other teammates do not end up getting penalised.</p>
                    <p>I have learn many skills in university, not just knowledge of Computing on a whole but many organisational and report writing skills have had a major impact on the way I plan and write reports/essays.</p>
                    <p>Overall my first year of University has been an invaluable experience and is something I feel very privileged to be undertaking.</p>
