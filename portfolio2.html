                    <h5>Navigation Application</h5>
                    <p>For our second project we were tasked with creating a navigation application for the Coventry University Engineering and Computing Building. The main aim of the project was to create 3 different kinds of prototypes each more complex than its predecessor and have real users from around the building test our application.</p>
                    <p>We began with creating a paper prototype for our application, we tried to include all the fields that a user would need from the application and a few extras to increase its functionality and usage life. We asked 5 people outside the university to look at out paper prototype and from it what they would press to find a specific room, from these tests we deducted what users found difficult and what they liked.</p>
                    <p>Once we conducted all 5 tests the group came together and we looked at the feedback sheet from each test and tried to remove the bad points from our application whilst implementing new ideas that the users wanted to see or would fix prior problems. We deduced that the users disliked all the white space in the application and that we could fill it with text or images to make the app more appealing.  The overall colour scheme we decided to keep the same being a turquoise blue and white. We created our own logo and named the application MyWay.</p>
                    <p>The final application was something we were quite proud of, we tried to make the interface as simple as possible using large buttons so users can easily change floors whilst walking to save time, we also increased the map size as well as adding a pinch to zoom feature that makes it even easier to navigate. A problem we came across when making the application was that we wanted to have a drop down list of ever room in the building and once the user chooses a room the application will navigate you to it with arrows. The problem with this idea was that the arrow can only go from one place to another and not automatically pin point the users current location. To overcome this problem we made it so that when the user chooses a room, a flashing red circle will appear at the rooms entrance so the user knows exactly where they are heading from there current location.</p>
                    <p>We yet again asked students around the building to test our application and give use some form of constructive feedback so we can implement it into further projects we create in the future. We wrote a few tasks on a piece of paper and asked a user to carry out the tasks using the application as a guide.</p>
                    <p>In this project the main thing I learnt was how valuable a usability test can be in the maintenance and making the application so much more user friendly. The paper and mid fidelity prototypes gave us some exceptionally constructive feedback from students who are the main audience for our application, we implemented the suggestions into our application as best we could. I understand how critical conducting user testing is and the impact it has on how successful a product can be and the amount of bugs it can help you avoid, thanks to this project I will be conducting user tests in all m projects in the foreseeable future.</p>
